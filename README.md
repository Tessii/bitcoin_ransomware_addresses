# bitcoin_ransomware_addresses

Abstract from our university report:
Bitcoin as a payment method for ransomware attacks has gained popularity in the past years. In this paper, we explore how the available information on Bitcoin addresses can be used to combat ransomware.  To achieve this objective,  the goal was to build two machine learning models: 1) To identify if a bitcoin address was used for ransomware payment and 2) To categorize to which ransomware family an abused address belongs to. The base dataset is the result of a previous study on ransomware and provides information about address, year, day, length, weight, looped, neighbors, income. Furthermore, the findings revealed that the Voting Classifier model delivers the best results for the first model and can serve as a new tool for law enforcement to combat ransomware attacks. However, the development of the second model was only partly successful, as it successfully identifies popular families, but it fails to classify new, small ransomware families. Overall, this demonstrates the need for more research on building models for imbalanced data.
